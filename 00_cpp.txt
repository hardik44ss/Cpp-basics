cpp =-> made by Bjare stroustrope 
used as extension of C near HARDWARE 

C++ = more control over system resourse , special :: GARBAGE COLLECTION 
memory management, fast program ,games and game engines 
high performance  , LOW level language 
major update in = 2011,2014,2017 

I = Integrated 
D = Developement 
E = Environment 

#include <iostream> header file 
io = input output 
int main is used to call the function which 
is present in the header file 
"using namespace std" : means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

variable used to store data 
=C++ range from 1 to 255 
=variable starts with alphabet and (_)--> case sensitive 
=can't use C++ reserved keyword 

cout used to print the data
 Boolean => (True=1 or false=0) 
 float = 4.445
 double = for long decimal places

 Local Variable = inside braces (It has precidence)
 Global = declared outside can be used anywhere in function

DATA TYPE :: 
    <Builtin --> int, float , etc 
    <User defined--> struct , Union , Enum 
    <Derived --> Array, Function , Pointer 

*C++ comes with library
to input 
    cin>> 
to print
    cout<<
endl used for new line
The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence,
To use global vatriable
use << ::g<<endl>>;

#include<iomanip>
(manipulator)
to use setw(number)--> to give spaces of particular number

**operator precidence**
a*b , a/b , a%b ==left to right
a+b a-b == left to right
****control structure*****
Sequence = Entry->Action1->action2->exit 
selection = condn{ True -> action1 || false -> action 2} -> exit
Loop = entry -> loop -> condn{true -> loop }if false -> action -> exit
for,while,dowhile
//FOR loop
    for(int i=0;i<=40;i++){
        cout<<i<<endl;
    }
//WHILE loop
    //syntex of while loop
    while (/* condition */)
    {
        /* code */
    }
//DO WHILe
    do
    {
        /* code */
    } while (/* condition */);
// first program run then check condition 
 
POINTERs= datatype which holds another data type
int* variable which holds address of a

To get length 
cout << varname.length(); // OR
cout << varname.size();
